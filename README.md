# Rubik_Cube_Visualizer
Rubik's Cube Visualizer in C++ and OpenGL.

To compile this you need to have:
  GLM library: http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html
  Freeglut: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net
  Glew: http://glew.sourceforge.net
  
Also you need to change your include, libs and dlls directory in this project.
Should work with C++14 compiler fine (VS2015 recommended).
